# QuickRent-Gadget-renting-platfrom

For my recent task, I created a responsive and visually appealing landing page for **QuickRent**, a platform for renting gadgets. This task challenged my skills in implementing a modern UI and ensuring responsiveness across both desktop and mobile. Here's what I worked on:

- Hero Banner: Crafted a catchy tagline with a strong call-to-action.
- Features Section: Highlighted key platform features like wide gadget variety and affordable pricing with engaging graphics.
- Gadget Listing: Displayed available gadgets for rent with pricing and comparison charts.
- Contact Us: Designed an interactive form with seamless UX.

I used html,css,javascript (or another preferred technology) and included subtle animations like hover effects and scroll fade-ins to elevate user experience. This project was a great opportunity to apply my skills and create a real-world product landing page.
